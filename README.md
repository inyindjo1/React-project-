# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

BookFinder Pro is a responsive and interactive book search application built with React.
It connects to the Open Library API to fetch and display book data based on user search input.
Users can search for books by title or keyword and view relevant results in a clean grid layout.
Each book card includes the cover image, title, author, and publication year when available.
The app allows users to save their favorite books, which are displayed in a separate "Favorites" tab.
State management is handled efficiently using Redux Toolkit and React-Redux hooks.
The favorites and search results are stored in Redux state, making data flow predictable and centralized.
The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS, giving the app a clean, modern look with gradient backgrounds and responsive components.
Lucide-react icons are used to enhance the visual elements like the header and buttons.
Error handling is included to show clear messages when something goes wrong during the API request.
A loading spinner is displayed while data is being fetched, improving user experience.
Users can also clear search results or dismiss error messages through intuitive button controls.
The application is divided into reusable components like SearchBar, BookGrid, FavoritesList, and ErrorMessage for better code organization.
While the app functions well for real-time search and browsing, future improvements could include localStorage for persistent favorites and search history tracking.
Overall, BookFinder Pro demonstrates how to build a real-world React app that consumes an external API, manages global state with Redux, and delivers a polished, user-friendly interface.
